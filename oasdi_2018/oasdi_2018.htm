Please Note: 
Of the 1384 total Social Security zip code records in the original fl.xlsx table 
only 975 are represented in the new OASDI_2018.shp layer.  This is because 409 of the 
zip code records in the fl.xlsx table are zip codes of P.O. Box locations which are not 
represented/mapped in the statewide ZIPBND_2012.shp layer.   Additionally please beware that 
there are 23 zip code records in the OASDI_2018.shp layer that have no data available.

OASDI Beneficiaries by State and ZIP Code, 2018
NOTES
This annual publication focuses on the Social Security beneficiary population people
receiving Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefits at the ZIP
Code level. It presents basic program data on the number and type of beneficiaries and
the amount of benefits paid in each state, Social Security Administration field office, and
ZIP Code. It also shows the number of men and women aged 65 or older receiving benefits.
The data include only persons whose benefits are currently payable. Those whose
benefits were withheld are excluded.
The data in this report are derived from the Master Beneficiary Record, the principal
administrative file of Social Security beneficiaries. The Social Security Detailed Office
Organization Resource System (DOORS) file was used to associate the field office data
with the ZIP Codes. Data for field offices in each state include only beneficiaries in that
state. However, some Social Security field offices serve residents of more than one
state. To obtain field office totals in these situations, it is necessary to combine data for
each state served by the field office. The data include only persons whose benefits are
currently payable. Those whose benefits were withheld are excluded.
To avoid disclosing the reason for Social Security eligibility of small groups and the
amounts of benefits received, a controlled rounding procedure was used for field office
and ZIP Code data. Data are not shown for ZIP Codes with fewer than 15 beneficiaries.
Under the controlled rounding procedure, ZIP Code data on the number of beneficiaries
shown in the table are changed according to the following formula:
1. If the number is divisible by 5 (ends in 0 or 5), then the numbers are not changed.
2. Otherwise, the number is rounded either to the next higher number divisible by 5
or the next lower number divisible by 5, in such a way that the difference between
each rounded and unrounded cell value, each rounded and unrounded row total,
and each rounded and unrounded column total is less than 5.
The dollar amounts in the tables are rounded to the nearest thousand.
Cherice Jefferies in the Office of Statistical Analysis and Support programmed and
compiled the data for this report. Staff of the Office of Dissemination edited the report
and prepared it for web publication.

Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:250,000.  

U.S. ZIP Code Areas (Five-Digit) represents five-digit ZIP Code areas 
used by the U.S. Postal Service to deliver mail more effectively. 
The first digit of a five-digit ZIP Code divides the United States into 10 
large groups of states numbered from 0 in the Northeast to 9 in the far 
West. Within these areas, each state is divided into an average of 10 
smaller geographical areas, identified by the second and third digits. 
These digits, in conjunction with the first digit, represent a sectional 
center facility or a mail processing facility area. The fourth and fifth digits 
identify a post office, station, branch or local delivery area.

The polygons identify areas where mail is delivered 
(from a city block or two to a whole rural town) within United States.<br /><br />

The Florida Geographic Data Library is a collection of Geospatial Data
compiled by the University of Florida GeoPlan Center with support from
the Florida Department of Transportation. GIS data available in FGDL is
collected from various state, federal, and other agencies (data sources)
who are data stewards, producers, or publishers. The data available in
FGDL may not be the most current version of the data offered by the
data source. University of Florida GeoPlan Center makes no guarantees
about the currentness of the data and suggests that data users check
with the data source to see if more recent versions of the data exist.

A note about data scale: 

Scale is an important factor in data usage.  Certain scale datasets
are not suitable for some project, analysis, or modeling purposes.
Please be sure you are using the best available data. 

1:24000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
county level.
1:24000 data should NOT be used for high accuracy base mapping such
as property parcel boundaries.
1:100000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
multi-county or regional level.
1:125000 scale datasets are recommended for projects that are at the
regional or state level or larger.

Vector datasets with no defined scale or accuracy should be
considered suspect. Make sure you are familiar with your data
before using it for projects or analysis. Every effort has been
made to supply the user with data documentation. For additional
information, see the References section and the Data Source Contact
section of this documentation. For more information regarding
scale and accuracy, see our webpage at:

<strong><b>DATA LINEAGE SUMMARY: </b></strong>
<br />
<table width="60%">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>
The GeoPlan Center performed the following steps in order to 
create the 2018 OASDI data layer.

-Downloaded 1384 records as an xlsx from https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/oasdi_zip/2018/index.html 
 and converted to csv after formatting in excel.
-Brought csv into arcmap, exported it as an DBF and joined it to FGDL layer: zipbnd_2012. 
 Of the 1384 records in the DBF, only 959 correctly joined based on ZIP. 
-This is because 425 records had zipcodes that were not standard, meaning they were PO boxes or another unique 
 form of mail storage
-To recover some of the lost data in the OASDI dbf, we were able to extract PO box zipcodes for the state of FL from 
 https://www.zip-codes.com/state/fl.asp
-Copy and pasted page with all 1472 zipcodes for FL to a excel sheet, and then deleted all "Standard" zipcodes from 
 the pile.
 This was because we already caught those using the FGDL layer: zipbnd_2012. 
-This excel sheet was then converted to a csv and exported as a DBF in arcmap, with 542 total PO box/ unique zipcodes
-We then joined these 542 records with the 2018 tiger ZCTA dataset based on the ZIP field, of the 542, 64 records 
 joined successfully based on zip. 
 This successfully gave these PO box zipcodes representative polygons.
-These 64 records were then extracted as a new polygon shapefile, which we then joined to the original OASDI 
 DBF based on ZIP. Of the 64 PO box records, 55 successfully joined to the OASDI dataset.
-Last, we merged these 55 with the 959 records that were successfully joined to the FGDL layer: zipbnd_2012, 
 making 1014 total records. 
-Added new zip field as text instead of long 
-Used .zfil() within the field calculator to add back leading zeros within the ZIP field lost in the merge

-added FGDLAQDATE based on the date the data was obtained by the GeoPlan Center
-added DESCRIPT field based on the field PO_NAME
-added UPDATE_DAY field based on the publication date of the data that was used to update the field

PLEASE NOTE:
-Upon checking the data and summarizing some fields, 16 duplicates were found. These duplicates were fixed by using 
 the merge editing tool to remove them, by merging the duplicates together, using the polygons that contained data as the 
 master. Each duplicate contained one record with data, one without. The ones without were merged into the ones with data. 
-998 total records after clean-up
-Records with no OASDI data contained values of "-99", these were all recalculated to have values of "0" instead to match 
 the format of the previous FGDL OASDI layer from 2010.
-23 records in total have no OASDI data
